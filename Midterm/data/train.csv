At the center of the solar system is the Sun, a star that contains more than 99.8% of the system's total mass. The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together and influences the orbits of all the planets and other celestial bodies. The planets are divided into two main categories: the terrestrial (or rocky) planets, which are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the jovian (or gas giant) planets, which are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Beyond the outermost planet, Neptune, lies the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and debris that extends out to about 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.
